## Overview
This is a project affiliated with the University of Chicago BSCD Quantitative Biology Fellowship in summer 2020. We aim to read through selected book chapters from Statistical Genetics (Neale et.al. 2008) and recreate some code and examples as exercise. 

## Chapter 5
Explanation of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium example in section 5.4 is recreated [here](statistical_power.html) with modified code and table. 

## Chapter 16
Since this book chapter is from 2008, we in fact followed a [newer tutorial](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/tutorial.shtml) for our plink exercise. Some results from the exercise are documented [here](plink.html)
